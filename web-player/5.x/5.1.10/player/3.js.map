If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curryN, R.partial\n * @example\n *\n *      const addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\n *\n *      const curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\n *      const f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      const g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nvar curry = /*#__PURE__*/_curry1(function curry(fn) {\n  return curryN(fn.length, fn);\n});\nexport default curry;","import _curry1 from './internal/_curry1.js';\nimport _identity from './internal/_identity.js';\n\n/**\n * A function that does nothing but return the parameter supplied to it.
